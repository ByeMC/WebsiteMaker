How to use examples:

It's easy to make websites if you use one of the following methods:
1) One-file method (Reccommended)
2) Two-file method

The file structure is
Examples
|   README.txt <-- You are here
|
+---one-file method
|       template.html
|       webmaker.py
|       webmakerlibs.py
|
\---two-file method
        footer.html
        header.html
        webmaker.py
        webmakerlibs.py

To use either method, run "webmaker.py" or write a program that uses "webmakerlibs.py", or run "webmakerlibs.py" in IDLE to use it in the shell.
